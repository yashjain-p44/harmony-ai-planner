# task-ai-poc
A POC for AI driven task manager scheduler

Comment - There is a tight coupling with google calendar bcz this project scope limits this. So I will proceed with just keeping google calendar, and not unnecessarily creating that loose coupling. That refactoring can be done later if req.

Till now Ai isn't integerated - it will done to create the plan requirement based on the user input and transform a wish to a goal.
